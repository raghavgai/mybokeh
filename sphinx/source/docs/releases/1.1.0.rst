1.1.0
=====

Bokeh Version ``1.1.0`` (January 2019) primarily


Migration Guide
---------------

New in 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``js_link`` function was added to make it simpler to link two Bokeh model
properties together:

.. code:: python

    slider.js_link('value', r.glyph, 'radius')

See :ref:`userguide_interaction_linked_properties` for more information.

The ``Slider.value_as_date`` method was added to conveniently retrieve Slider
values as date objects when appropriate.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following features or APIs were deprecated in version 1.1 and will be
removed in a future 2.0 release:

* Support for CoffeeScript in ``CustomJS`` or custom extensions. Use JavaScript
  or Typescript instead.

* Support for ``ClientSession.loop_until_closed``. This function is intented
  to support testing only, and will be removed from the public API. Bokeh
  applications should be run directly on a Bokeh server.

* Support for "transpiling" Python code to JavaScript. All ``from_py_func``
  methods will be removed. Use JavaScript or Typescript instead.
